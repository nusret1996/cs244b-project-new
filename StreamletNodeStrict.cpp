/*
 * Implements a stricter version Streamlet protocol that follows the protocol description
 * in the paper more closely. All messages concerning a block, including its proposal and
 * all votes, must arrive within an epoch. This implementation is therefore more susceptible
 * to clock skew, based on what external reference nodes have had their system clock synchronized
 * to, and clock drift. Within an epoch, however, proposals and votes may still arrive out
 * of order, unlike in the paper, since this cannot be controlled in a real network.
 *
 * The service implements the RPC server using the synchronous interface and acts as an RPC
 * client using the asynchronous interface so that broadcasts to other nodes do not block
 * request processing.
